This is the README file for edfile project, which is assignment 2 for CS12 at UCSC under Prof. Whitehead.
This project allows the user to edit a file via the command line with a very basic set of commands. The editor makes
use of a doubly linked list to perform the storing and editing of each file, with each line in the file making a single
node in the doubly linked list. The dll is defined in dllist.java, and the main program is defined inside of edfile.java.

A list of files is given below :
dllist.java      - Defines the doubly linked list.
dllistTest.java  - Testing suite for the doubly linked list.
edfile.java      - Main class for the program, includes the main function.
auxlib.java      - Contains auxilary functions for the project.
Makefile         - Defines how to make all of the different parts of the project, including the individual classes, the testing suite, the main program, and more.
README           - This file, describes the project.

The project usage is as follows :

java edfile [-e] filename

"-e"          is an optional argument that will make the program echo any commands back to the user.
"filename"    is the name of the file that you wish to open for editing.
