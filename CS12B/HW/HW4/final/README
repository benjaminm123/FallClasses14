README file for the CYOA program, Assignment #4, CS12, UC Santa Cruz.

The cyoa program is a program that can run many different types of text-based adventure games. The user starts
in the first room defined in the adventure file, and can move from room to room while exploring the game map.
Only certain rooms share connections though, so the task of navigating between two specific rooms is not as cut
and dry as it may seem to be.

Quick Start Guide :

make                // build the project
cyoa demo.adventure // run the game on the included demo adventure file

To win the game :
bacababcbad (One of many ways to reach the winning room)
