This is the README file for Lab #4 for CS12 at UCSC during the Fall of 2014. The purpose of this lab was to create a 
circular buffered queue in the C programming language, then run a series of unit tests on this queue's implementation to make
sure that it is correct. The queue can hold a maximum of 100 elements, where each element is a single integer. The queue's 
implementation consists of 2 points, one to the front of the queue and one to the back of the queue.
