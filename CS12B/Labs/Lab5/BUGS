BUGS report
CS12 Data Structures

This file lists and breifly describes the bugs that I found and corrected in the original list.c file

Line 23,     list_insert2 function - simplified this by turning it into two calls to list insert, one for b and one for a
Line 39,     list_remove  function - We need to free n->next when we remove it from the chain, at the original state we were just removing the reference to it.
Lines 57-59, list_destroy function - It only destroyed the head ptr, it needs to go through the entirety of the list and delete all pointers.
