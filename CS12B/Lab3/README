This README is for the Reverse Polish Notation Calculator project, which is Lab#3 for CS12M at UCSC. This project was written by John Allard, ID#1437547.

This project contains the following files

Calc.java
Stack.java
CalcTest.java
README
Makefile

Calc.java is the source for the Calc class, which is the main class for this program. This class is basically a wrapper for the Stack class, and allows the user to perform simple calculations using reverse polish notation. The available operations to the user are 
pop
peek
push
add
multiply
subtract
divide
reciprocal

Stack.java is the source for the Stack class, which is a helper-class for the Calc class. This is a very simple implementation of a stack that I developed just for this project.

CalcTest.java is the testing program for Calc class. It will perform a suite of 26 tests to help ensure that everything is running okay. It can be run from the command line with the command `make test`.

The README file is this. For more information, see README.

The Makefile is used to build the program. It builds the classes Calc.class, Stack.class, and CalcTest.class from their respective source files, then builds an executable out of these classes.
